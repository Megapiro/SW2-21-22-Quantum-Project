# RP5.1: State-of-the-art analysis
The research on quantum computing today is still focusing mostly on addressing technical problems at the physical and hardware level. For instance, an important issue that is being considered is how to deal with interferences in the hardware that cause significant noise in the results obtained by a quantum computer. Programming a quantum computer still means combining low level quantum logic gates in a quantum circuit. In this panorama, though, we see significant emerging efforts aiming at making the adoption of quantum computers possible by non-specialists. The purpose of this research work is to develop a systematic analysis of the state of the art on quantum computing trying to classify the various efforts in this field and to identify the aspects at the edge of research in each of the identified categories.
