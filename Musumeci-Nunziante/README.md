# RP5.3: The Gate and the Annealing Quantum Models

Nowadays the state of the art of quantum computing is characterized by the so-called NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era where two main paradigms are developing in parallel, the gate and the annealing models. The results show that solving problems with quantum annealing allows us to consider instances that are almost as large/complex as some representing real world scenarios. However, the main distinction that we also have to consider is that quantum solutions based on the gate model allow to define a universal quantum computer while those based on quantum annealing apply some approximations which do not allow to achieve universality. The goal of this research project is to start with the analysis of the two models identifying their features and produce a comparison. Then to consider a tool example to be implemented on both the paradigms and compare the solutions.
