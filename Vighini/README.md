# Project 5.5 - Quantum Natural Language Processing

QNLP is a branch of quantum computing that focuses on natural language processing tasks. 
The advantage of using QC instead of classical computing in NLP problems is that NLP is quantum native. 
Pictorial representation is largely used in this field instead classical mathematics.

## Progress

### In progress:

Topics being studied:
* quantum computing basics;
* NLP;
* QNLP.

### Completed:

Material studied:
* introductory videos on slack about quantum computing;
* udemy lecture on QNLP.

### Notes:

* I found out one of the most relevant people in QNLP is Bob Coecke, which took conferences that are now shared on YouTube.
